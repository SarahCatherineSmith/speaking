# DC Tech Call for Papers

Do you want to speak at a DC meetup? How about find a speaker for your meetup? You're in the right place!

There are a lot of talks that would be awesome for multiple meetups in DC, and it's difficult to pitch to all of them at once right now. Organizers are always looking for speakers. This repository bridges that gap by allowing speakers to pitch their talks to a bunch of meetups all at once.

## Speakers

Please [fill out an issue](https://github.com/dctech/cfps/issues/new) with information about your proposed talk. There's a template with some questions to answer about your talk within that issue. Feel free to skip any you don't feel comfortable answering.

## Organizers

Reach out to the speakers whose talks interest you! Also, add tags to the issues so their easier to wade through.
